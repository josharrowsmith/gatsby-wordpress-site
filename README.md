# Portfolio site 
Rebuilding my portfolio site using Gatsby and the Wordpress RESTFUL API, 
its currently using acf page builder to make things a bit easier instead of sorting the categories,
this is only the backend layout of the page for now. 


## TODO
- [ ] styling everything !!
- [ ] particle.js as backgrond ?
- [ ] look into how tags and categories work with gatsby
- [ ] Use gatsby-plugin for lazy-loading images
- [ ] sass and css
- [ ] maybe see if react vr works with gatsby ???????
